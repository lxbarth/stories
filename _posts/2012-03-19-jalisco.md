## Live in Jalisco? Add your roads to OSM today. 

We are excited to release a large dataset of all the major roads Mexican state of Jalisco that you can use to add road data to OpenStreetMap.

As part of our [OpenStreetMap mapping sprint](http://mapbox.com/blog/satellite-tracing-osm/) we wanted to really complete the map with road names and enrich the OSM database, especially after spending so much time [tracing in Gudalajara](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mapbox/6839220552/in/photostream). After a bit of research we came across Jalisco's Online State Information System([SITEL](http://sitel.jalisco.gob.mx/index2.php) in spanish), the state governments online open data presence. We focused on three datasets: highways, main roads, and streets that are maintained by the state of Jalisco.

We converted the shapefiles into one .osm file that you can open with [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/) and copy into an active layer, manually making connections with roads that already exist in OSM. Alternatively, you can trace your own roads and simply migrate the tags from our prepared layer. To learn more about how you can use this data to improve road coverage in Jalisco or to learn more about how we processed the data, read the [project's documentation](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-jalisco/blob/master/README.md).

All three files are configured such that they can't be directly to OSM, since they will likely create conflict errors. If you are interested in securing data from your own local government, be sure to [read about scripted imports](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) and contact the local OSM community before doing anything.   

You can find these files as well as a quick tutorial on how to import them into OpenStreetMap's open source desktop editor [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/) in our public [osm-jalisco repo](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-jalisco) on github.
